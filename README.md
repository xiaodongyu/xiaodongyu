# Xiaodong Yu

## Overview

I design and deploy applied machine learning systems with an emphasis on **end-to-end product ownership** and **real-world decision-making**.

My background is in revenue management, dynamic pricing, and demand forecasting.

My current focus is on **building, shipping, and operating AI-powered products**, not isolated models.

## What This GitHub Demonstrates

This repository collection showcases **the full lifecycle of AI product productionization**, from problem framing to deployment and iteration.

### 🧠 Product Definition & Problem Framing

* Johari Window for uncertainty and stakeholder alignment
* Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) for outcome-driven design
* User Story Mapping for scope and dependency control
* Kano analysis for feature prioritization
* MVP definition with explicit success and failure criteria

### 🛠️ AI-Assisted Full-Stack Development

* End-to-end system design (backend, evaluation logic, lightweight UI)
* AI as a development collaborator, not a black-box dependency
* Rapid iteration with explicit architectural and design tradeoffs

### 🤖 GenAI in Production

* Prompt architecture and versioning
* Evaluation frameworks and failure mode analysis
* Cost, latency, and reliability tradeoffs in deployed systems

### 🔁 Production Lifecycle & Project Management

* Iterative development with decision logs and experiment tracking
* Maintainability, extensibility, and handoff-oriented design
* Project management practices aligned with real delivery constraints

## Representative Projects

* **Language Learning Diagnostic Assistant**
  JTBD-driven MVP with explicit pass/fail learning signals

* **Career Fit Engine**
  Role taxonomy, evaluation heuristics, and GenAI-assisted reasoning pipeline

(See individual repositories for implementation details.)

## Intent

These projects reflect the direction I am intentionally moving toward:
**owning AI products from problem definition through deployment and iteration**, not just model development.
